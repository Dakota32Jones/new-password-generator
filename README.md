Password Generator

## Description

The purpose of this activity was to create a password generator using javascript only. This password generator was used to show my skills and knowledge of the javascript language. The password can only be between 8-128 characters and contain certain text to meet the criteria of the password. This helps with security purposes in other application when requestion passwords from a client. During this project I learned how to use if and else if statements. I also learned how to make variables and create functions and how I can use them together to create an application deplyed on a webpage.
